## Haskell Simple Chess Engine

## Description:

This project implements part of the engine for a chess game in Haskell. The following functions are supported:

- initializeBoard: Initializes a chess board to its starting position.
- visualizeBoard: Visualizes the chess board to the console.
- movePiece: Moves a piece on the board according to its movement rules.
- suggestLegalMoves: Suggests all possible legal moves for any piece on the board.

The following assumptions are made:
- There are no promotions of pawns.
- It is legal for a king to move to locations in which he will be threatened.
